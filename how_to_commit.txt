Should I ever forget, this is how it all works.

$ git init
I don't have to use this anymore but I have this now.

$ git add <filename>
This can be one file, two file, red file, blue file, just as long as it works.

$ git commit -m "<message>"
Commits the work from line 6, along with a message.

git remote add origin https://github.com/InnocuousBarrel/server.git
git remote -v
I don't think I have to use this either but it's one of those things.

git push origin master
Completes the master plan.
